# Simple Pendulum Simulation Engine (C++ RK4 & Full-Stack Web Visualizer)

An interactive, full-stack physics simulation of a simple pendulum. Instead of relying on standard browser-side JavaScript approximations, this project executes a compiled **C++ physics engine** implementing the **4th-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4)** numerical integration method on the backend, bridged to an HTML5 Canvas dark-mode visualizer via a **Node.js / Express** server[cite: 1, 4, 9].

## Algorithm & Mathematical Model

### 1. The Physical Model
The motion of an idealized simple pendulum of length L under acceleration due to gravity $g$ is governed by the non-linear second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE).

### 2. 4th-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4) Numerical Method
To solve this non-linear differential equation with high numerical stability and minimal truncation error, the second-order system is decoupled into a system of two first-order ODEs:
* First-order differentiation of d(theta) over d(time) = Angular Velocity.
* Second-order differentiation of d(theta) over d(time) = negative (g/L) * Sin(theta).

The **RK4 algorithm** evaluates four weighted incremental slopes  over each discrete time step dt.
This yields an error bound, providing an exceptionally accurate trajectory profile even across extended oscillation cycles and wider angles.

### 3. Cycle Period Tracking Algorithm
The client-side script parses the generated time-series data points to detect zero-crossings where the angular displacement or velocity changes sign, computing the exact elapsed time between matching turning points to dynamically log individual to-and-fro period durations.

## System Architecture & Workflow
1. **Frontend Dashboard (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`):** Captures user inputs for string length ($0.1\text{ m}$ to $4.0\text{ m}$) and initial release angle ($-20.0^\circ$ to $20.0^\circ$), rendering a 60 FPS HTML5 Canvas animation[cite: 1, 4].
2. **Backend Bridge (`server.js`):** Listens for parameters via `POST /run-simulation`, detects the host environment (Windows vs. Linux), and executes the compiled binary (`engine.exe` or `./engine`) safely[cite: 3, 4, 6].
3. **Data Pipeline:** The C++ engine computes the trajectory loop, outputs the Cartesian coordinates to `angles.csv`, which is fetched and rendered instantly by the web interface[cite: 1, 4].
